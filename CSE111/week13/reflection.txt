1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

This semester was my first semester learning Python. It was a challenge at the beggining of the semester, but I strive to learn 
and work with my team. The team activities were the most meaningful experiences that I have.
I really enjoyed to work and learn from my team. They were really helpful.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

It helps us to test the correct funcionality of a function. This helps to use the function more 
effectevely in in the programs.
It ensures a product performs as it should. When customers receive a product, they expect it to perform as advertised. 




3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

First, I run the program. If the program has any error code, I read the code, and  I go to the line that has the 
problem. If I dont know the error, I look on internet the erro code. Once I found the error, I fix the line.
